REDUCE IDE is an Integrated Development Environment for the REDUCE
computer algebra system.  It provides major modes for editing REDUCE
source code and running a command-line version of REDUCE in an Emacs
window.  However, many of the facilities require that Emacs is running
under a GUI such as Microsoft Windows or the X Window System under
some flavour of UNIX or Linux.

I currently use GNU Emacs 28 (on Microsoft Windows) for development
and testing, and REDUCE IDE may not work correctly with older
versions.

The user's guide is installed automatically as part of this package as
an info document, which should appear at the top of your info
directory.  It is also available as a PDF document or a multi-page
HTML document via the website.
